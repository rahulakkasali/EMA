Stock Price and EMA Analysis:

This project demonstrates how to calculate and analyze the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of stock prices using Python and pandas. It includes data handling, EMA computation, and visualization of stock price along with EMA values.

Project Overview:

>Implements the logic of EMA, an important technical indicator in financial analysis.

>Uses pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for plotting.

>Provides code to analyze minute-by-minute changes in stock price and EMA values.

>Visualizes data with grouped bar charts and histograms to compare raw and smoothed price trends.

Features:

>Calculation of EMA using pandas .ewm() method with customizable period.

>Visualization of stock price vs EMA as grouped bar charts to compare values side by side.

>Plotting histograms to understand distribution of prices and EMA values.

>Support for setting specific y-axis scale ranges for focused analysis.
